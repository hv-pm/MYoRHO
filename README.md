# MYoRHO (Myoelectric Robotic Hand Orthosis)
MYoRHO is a Non-invasive Muscle-Machine Interface Open Source Project: Wearable Hand Robotic Orthosis (MES-RO)
it uses a user-tuned approach to develop a custom MES-RO for a user by having their metrics (ergonomics and surface myoelectric signals) added in the design cycle.
